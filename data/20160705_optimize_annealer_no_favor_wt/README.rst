I decided to get rid of the "favor wildtype" term, because the unknown bias it 
was introducing made it hard to interpret the data.  However, changing the 
score function means reoptimizing the annealing cycles and temperature.

I didn't really look too carefully at the plots, but the score function doesn't 
really seem that different and N=300, T=5 still looks like the best.  And if 
they're not the best, they're definitely not horrible.  I'm going to move 
forward without changing the parameters.
